#Repair-design-project

In this project, for compilation SCSS, I used [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com) collector
If tou want to start the server you need to install Gulp `npm install --save-dev gulp ` and `npm install browser-sync gulp --save-dev` in the command line in the project directory write `gulp browser-sync`
And the project will start.
